This is a program written mainly using React.
It has functionality to create as many notes as desired, and store them in local storage to read again upon re-opening the app.
Each note is completely updatable just by typing in the title or description.
There is also functionality to search among the title or description of existing notes and filters notes according to search term instantly.
Lastly, notes can be deleted with the x in the corner of each note.

I wrote the code using CodeSandbox, utilizing the preview functionality while it was in progress and uploaded upon completion to GitHub for retention and sharing.
